faustnet is a cli program that can perform GET, POST, and DELETE requests as a Client
Can also start a simple HTTP server(still in progress) and can serve text files to clients(i.e. other faustnet instances)

run go build and go install to have access to "faustnet" as a cli command

I had a few issues with installing on my local machine but this is assumed to be a Windows issue of not appropriately adding to path

I am still new to Go and would like feedback if you're able to provide it
